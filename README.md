# Maximizing Revenue for Drivers Through Payment Type Analysis

This project explores the relationship between payment types and fare amounts in the taxi booking sector, aiming to provide data-driven insights to maximize revenue streams for taxi drivers.

## Problem Statement

Maximizing revenue is essential for long-term success and driver satisfaction in the fast-paced taxi booking sector. This project aims to use data-driven insights to achieve this goal.

## Research Question

* Is there a relationship between total fare amount and payment type?
* Can we nudge customers towards payment methods that generate higher revenue for drivers, without negatively impacting customer experience?


## Methodology

The methodology includes the following steps:

1.  **Descriptive Analysis:** Statistical analysis to summarize key aspects of the data, focusing on fare amounts and payment type
2.  **Hypothesis Testing:** A T-test to evaluate the relationship between payment type and fare amount. 
3.  **Regression Analysis:** Linear regression to explore the relationship between trip duration and fare amount.


## Hypothesis Testing

* Null hypothesis: There is no difference in average fare between customers who use credit cards and customers who use cash.
* Alternative hypothesis: There is a difference in average fare between customers who use credit cards and customers who use cash.

The null hypothesis was rejected (T-statistic = 165.5, P-value < 0.05), indicating a significant difference in average fare between card and cash payments.
